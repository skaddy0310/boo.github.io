                <h2>When we first met in the train</h2>
                <p>Our eyes first met across the crowded train car, an unspoken treaty being forged between two strangers. In that moment, we became ambassadors to one another's hearts - transcending borders, connecting cultures. Though from different nations, we negotiated an intimate diplomacy. With each smile exchanged, we ratified new accords of attraction. The gentle sway of the carriage rocked us closer, like the ebb and flow of international relations. As the train made stops, allowing others to disembark, our bond grew stronger - a sovereign union between just us two. Through the panoramic windows life raced by, but in our compartment, we were crafting the most special of international agreements - one of everlasting love.</p>
